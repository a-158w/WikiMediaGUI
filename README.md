# WikiMediaGUI

Simple university project to introduce me to creating GUI applications using java fx. It allows a user to search for a term in wikipedia and converts the result to a video with that term and the information read out (using text-to-speech).

What I learnt:
- How GUI threads work (application versus task) and what should be executed on them.
- How to run linux bash commands in java processes.
- Basic java multithreading.
- How to use scene builder with java fx.
- How GUI components are used.

What I would improve:
- Would make the code "cleaner" (i.e. more appropriate use of commenting and reduced code where possible).
- Use Git for VCM throughout the project.
- Implement far more rigorous error handling.
- Improve the design of the UI (both in terms of experience, and in terms of aesthetic).
